# Blender Daily Build

This repository targets to build Blender daily for the purpose that validates your own Blender scripts and add-ons on the latest Blender built by the latest Blender's source codes.

The built Blender can be downloaded via the [GitHub Action's artifacts](https://github.com/nutti/blender-daily-build/actions).
Not to exceed the limit of the artifact's capacity, all Blenders older than 3 days will be deleted.
